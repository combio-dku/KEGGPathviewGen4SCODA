\usage{
get_pathways_map(adata, min_overlap = 0.85)
}
\arguments{
\item{adata}{SCODA-processed anndata object.}

\item{min_overlap}{a number between 0 and 1. Used to filter the matched KEGG pathways. The overlap is defined by the number of genes common in the two pathways divided by the smallest gene set size}
}
\value{
a data frame containing the mapping between the KEGG pathway and the pathway used in the SCODA
}
\description{
This function retreives mapping between the KEGG pathways and the pathways DB used.
Using the gene sets defined in the two pathways DBs, it selects, for each pathway in the SCODA Gene Set Analysis result, the KEGG pathway with the best match.
